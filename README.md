Logic Scripts
==================
2016-07-20



This page contains my logic scripts:

- cc remapper





CC remapper
-------------------

This script listen to a control change on a given channel, 
and remaps it to another.

Why?

My keyboard doesn't have a modwheel, but I own a nanoKONTROL2 control surface,
so this script allows me to use any nanoKONTROL2 fader as the modulation wheel.

By extension of this script, we can easily map any channel-cc pair to what we need.
